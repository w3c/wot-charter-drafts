    <section>
      <h2 id="discovery-improvements-workitem">Discovery Improvements</h2>
      <p>Various updates are expected to be needed to align the Discovery spec with updates to other proposed
      deliverables in this charter, for example updates to the information model, including support for all versions of
      the Thing Description specification, and to improve security and validation.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="discovery-thing-models-workitem">Discovery of Thing Models</h2>
      <p>Currently only Thing Descriptions can be stored in TD Directories, but it would be useful to also store Thing
      Models in them, in particular to allow links to Thing Models to be resolved by reference to a TD Directory.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="discovery-coap-dir-workitem">Discovery CoAP Directory</h2>
      <p>Currently, TD Directory services only have an HTTP API defined. TD Directories are the only Discovery
      exploration mechanism supporting the return of multiple Thing Descriptions, and they may also be needed in the
      case of constrained devices hosting multiple Things. However, the cost of using HTTP in constrained environments
      can be prohibitive. Defining a CoAP API with equivalent functionality to the HTTP API would allow the API to be
      used and provided by constrained devices, including those that simply want to self-host multiple TDs.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="discovery-jsonpath-query-language-workitem">Discovery JSON Path Query Language</h2>
      <p>Currently there is no mandatory query language support for TD Directories. This means that consumers will
      often need to download the contents of the entire directory if the id of a target TD is not known. An endpoint
      for SPARQL queries is defined but because of the difficulty of supporting RDF processing it is optional. JSON
      Path is still currently under discussion as an IETF RFC but was not mature enough to include during the last
      charter. JSON Path queries would complement the current SPARQL-based query support but would be lighter-weight to
      implement and use.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="discovery-query-filters-workitem">Discovery Query Filters</h2>
      <p>Some simple query filters would be added to the API for specific common use cases, such as filtering by type,
      time, or keyword. These filters would be chainable with each other and with query language results, so that, for
      example, the result of a JSON Path query might them be filtered by time without needing to complicate the JSON
      Path query with time computations. This mechanism would also be able to support <a href=
      "#geolocation-workitem">filtering by geolocation</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="geolocation-workitem">Geolocation</h2>
      <p>Many WoT use cases have identified a need to limit discovery by geographic location or to identify the
      location of a Thing. To support this, a standard way to encode geolocation metadata is needed (or several ways,
      each identified using a profile) and (for discovery) query mechanisms that can filter by this metadata.
      Geolocation metadata should be aligned with existing standards, and should support both static and dynamic
      situations. Geolocation information may be included in either TDs or in data delivered directly from the Thing
      and ideally both situations would be supported. Since multiple standards and use cases exist for geolocation
      information, profiles to constrain how it should be encoded in particular situations (for example, in Building
      Information Management Systems) would be useful.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="onboarding-workitem">Onboarding</h2>
      <p>In order to establish secure communications in some contexts, for example on a LAN, some form of onboarding
      process to establish mutual trust between Things and Consumers is needed. Having a prescriptive (but optional)
      process for this would be useful. Onboarding is part of the larger WoT Thing lifecycle which is described in the
      Architecture document. In this work item we will define mechanisms to perform secure minimum-effort onboarding of
      Things that conforms to the security and privacy requirements of specific deployment scenarios and use cases.
      This work item complements the work that is done for device discovery, and is in particular useful when
      registering TDs with a TD Directory service, however is also applicable for other use cases.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="sec-ontology-workitem">Security Scheme Ontology</h2>
      <p>Currently security schemes are "baked into" the TD specification but it would be more manageable and
      consistent to break them out as separate ontologies so that all security schemes would be done via extensions.
      For protocol-specific security schemes in particular, these should be moved to the Protocol Bindings and
      ontologies supporting them. The TD 2.0 spec would be updated to only include general-purpose "structural"
      security schemes and "generic" schemes that apply to all protocols.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="signing-workitem">Signing</h2>
      <p>Mechanisms for signing TDs documents were under discussion in the last charter but were not mature enough to
      include. Adding support for TD canonicalization and signing would be helpful to ensure that TDs are not
      intercepted and modified by third parties. Verifying a signature requires identity management, i.e. the verifier
      needs to know or have trusted access to the public key of the signer. Directories need to be extended to verify
      signatures and generate new chained signatures as needed.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="timeseries-workitem">Timeseries</h2>
      <p>Some edge and cloud services can collect property value changes or event emissions for a certain time. This
      data, called timeseries, can be retrieved by Consumers to display the evolution of the affordance data over time,
      make predictions about the future values and more. There are different serialization formats and structures of
      such data in existing solutions. The generic mechanism for timeseries should be introduced in the <a href=
      "#thing-description-deliverable">Thing Description</a> with bindings to existing solutions illustrated in the
      <a href="#binding-deliverable">Binding Templates</a></p>
      <p>Related Issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/892</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="payload-protocols-workitem">Payload Driven Protocols</h2>
      <p>Some protocols are built on top of the application layer protocols. Some examples are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>RPC protocols on top of HTTP such as JSON-RPC.</li>
        <li>Protocols using MQTT topics together with payloads to identify affordances.</li>
        <li>Websocket sub-protocols.</li>
        <li>SSE usage across implementations.</li>
        <li>Webhook usage across implementations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>The <a href="#thing-description-deliverable">Thing Description</a> should be updated with mechanisms that make
      it possible to describe such protocols while optimizing the TD instances to be human and machine readable. The
      <a href="#binding-deliverable">Binding Templates</a> should be updated with concrete cases where this mechanism
      is already used. The <a href="#profiles-deliverable">Profiles</a> can use this mechanism to reduce the size of
      TDs while making them easier to understand. The working group will also document in which cases this method does
      not work due to making the TDs too complicated to understand, thus requiring a binding document.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="manageable-actions-workitem">Manageable Actions</h2>
      <p>Various use cases require the implementation of more complex actions that span multiple protocol transactions.
      Such actions are not simply invoked but need to managed over time by the Thing and the Consumer. These are
      covered in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/">WoT Thing Description 1.1</a> via the
      initiation (<code>invokeaction</code>), monitoring (<code>queryaction</code>), and cancellation
      (<code>cancelaction</code>) of ongoing actions. However, the following points are not supported:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sent and received payloads associated to the operations</li>
        <li>Management of dynamically generated identification</li>
        <li>Describing queues of actions</li>
      </ul>These limitations are also influencing the <a href="#profiles-deliverable">Profiles</a>.
      <p></p>
      <p>Additionally, there have been proposals by the WG members that need to taken into account and evaluated:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/tree/main/proposals/hypermedia-control</li>
        <li>https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/tree/main/proposals/hypermedia-control-2</li>
        <li>https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/tree/main/proposals/hypermedia-control-3</li>

      </ul>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="init-connection-workitem">Initial / Common Connection Description</h2>
      <p>Currently, each form of an affordance has information on the endpoint, media type and other protocol related
      information. It is possible to use the <code>base</code> term for simplifying the endpoint but it has limitations
      such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the media type is also common across forms, it is repeated</li>
        <li>Multiple bases are not possible</li>
        <li>For protocols that are based on an initial connection and then subsequent messages, the semantics are not
        clear.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p>Thus, a mechanism to describe connection and protocol information that can be used by other forms is needed.
      In protocols with initial connection, this can be also used to indicate what needs to be done by the Consumer
      before executing any operation.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 id="canon-workitem">Canonicalization</h2>
      <p>Thing Descriptions can contain the same information but serialized differently even in the same serialization
      format, due to structures such as maps which do not impose an order. This is problematic for comparing TDs or
      more importantly, for signing them where every byte difference results in a different signature. Thus, the WG
      will develop a canonicalization algorithm based on JSON-LD.</p>

      <h2 id="td-versioning-workitem">TD Versioning</h2>
      <p>TD allows themselves to be versioned. However, the semantics of such versioning is not defined, i.e. the
      meaning of version numbers. This makes it difficult to manage TDs and results in different behavior across
      versioned TD repositories. The WG will define the semantics of versions of a TD and recommendations on how to
      manage different versions of TDs.</p>

      <h2 id="td-consumption-workitem">TD Parsing, Consumption and Validation</h2>
      <p>Currently the TD specification defines an abstract information model and a default JSON serialization for TDs.
      However, parsing, consuming and validating TDs are not normatively defined. A validation process is defined but
      is not normative, which leads to certain ambiguities for a Consumer parsing a TD. Additionally, no method is
      proposed for validation the extensions that are used via the prefixes and the <code>@context</code>. The WG will
      specify normative algorithms for parsing, consuming and validating TDs to ensure interoperability of
      Consumers.</p>

      <h2 id="td-linting-workitem">TD Linting</h2>
      <p>Linting rules exist for programming languages or for API specifications in order to establish custom rules
      within projects. How these rules can be defined for TDs is not specified in any way, making it difficult to
      constrain flexibility of TDs in a standardized manner. The WG will define the mechanism for linting TDs together
      with optional rules that can be used by different projects.</p>

      implement the following action items:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ask the WoT CG for the WG members to be invited in W3C WoT CG meetups.</li>
        <li>Ask for use cases from the WoT CG and analyze them.</li>
        <li>Collect implementations from CG participants for Plugfest and Testfest efforts.</li>

        Draft, including a first basic HTTP-based profile, to a Recommendation.
        </li>
        <li>Normatively define one or more profiles which specify how to observe properties and subscribe to events
        over HTTP, e.g. using Server-Sent Events and/or Webhooks</li>
        <li>Consider defining other profiles, e.g. a CoAP-based profile for constrained devices which do not have the
        resources to implement HTTP-based profiles</li>
        <li>Stretch goal: Specify an updated profiling mechanism which better integrates with the extension points of
          other WoT specifications and more precisely defines what profiles can constrain</li>
