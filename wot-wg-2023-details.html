      <section>
        <h3 id="discovery-improvements-workitem">Discovery Improvements</h3>
        <p>Various updates are expected to be needed to align the Discovery spec with updates to other proposed
        deliverables in this charter, for example updates to the information model, including support for all versions
        of the Thing Description specification, and to improve security and validation.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="discovery-thing-models-workitem">Discovery of Thing Models</h3>
        <p>Currently only Thing Descriptions can be stored in TD Directories, but it would be useful to also store
        Thing Models in them, in particular to allow links to Thing Models to be resolved by reference to a TD
        Directory.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="discovery-coap-dir-workitem">Discovery CoAP Directory</h3>
        <p>Currently, TD Directory services only have an HTTP API defined. TD Directories are the only Discovery
        exploration mechanism supporting the return of multiple Thing Descriptions, and they may also be needed in the
        case of constrained devices hosting multiple Things. However, the cost of using HTTP in constrained
        environments can be prohibitive. Defining a CoAP API with equivalent functionality to the HTTP API would allow
        the API to be used and provided by constrained devices, including those that simply want to self-host multiple
        TDs.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="discovery-jsonpath-query-language-workitem">Discovery JSON Path Query Language</h3>
        <p>Currently there is no mandatory query language support for TD Directories. This means that consumers will
        often need to download the contents of the entire directory if the id of a target TD is not known. An endpoint
        for SPARQL queries is defined but because of the difficulty of supporting RDF processing it is optional. JSON
        Path is still currently under discussion as an IETF RFC but was not mature enough to include during the last
        charter. JSON Path queries would complement the current SPARQL-based query support but would be lighter-weight
        to implement and use.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="discovery-query-filters-workitem">Discovery Query Filters</h3>
        <p>Some simple query filters would be added to the API for specific common use cases, such as filtering by
        type, time, or keyword. These filters would be chainable with each other and with query language results, so
        that, for example, the result of a JSON Path query might them be filtered by time without needing to complicate
        the JSON Path query with time computations. This mechanism would also be able to support <a href=
        "#geolocation-workitem">filtering by geolocation</a>.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="geolocation-workitem">Geolocation</h3>
        <p>Many WoT use cases have identified a need to limit discovery by geographic location or to identify the
        location of a Thing. To support this, a standard way to encode geolocation metadata is needed (or several ways,
        each identified using a profile) and (for discovery) query mechanisms that can filter by this metadata.
        Geolocation metadata should be aligned with existing standards, and should support both static and dynamic
        situations. Geolocation information may be included in either TDs or in data delivered directly from the Thing
        and ideally both situations would be supported. Since multiple standards and use cases exist for geolocation
        information, profiles to constrain how it should be encoded in particular situations (for example, in Building
        Information Management Systems) would be useful.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="onboarding-workitem">Onboarding</h3>
        <p>In order to establish secure communications in some contexts, for example on a LAN, some form of onboarding
        process to establish mutual trust between Things and Consumers is needed. Having a prescriptive (but optional)
        process for this would be useful. Onboarding is part of the larger WoT Thing lifecycle which is described in
        the Architecture document. In this work item we will define mechanisms to perform secure minimum-effort
        onboarding of Things that conforms to the security and privacy requirements of specific deployment scenarios
        and use cases. This work item complements the work that is done for device discovery, and is in particular
        useful when registering TDs with a TD Directory service, however is also applicable for other use cases.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="sec-ontology-workitem">Security Scheme Ontology</h3>
        <p>Currently security schemes are "baked into" the TD specification but it would be more manageable and
        consistent to break them out as separate ontologies so that all security schemes would be done via extensions.
        For protocol-specific security schemes in particular, these should be moved to the Protocol Bindings and
        ontologies supporting them. The TD 2.0 spec would be updated to only include general-purpose "structural"
        security schemes and "generic" schemes that apply to all protocols.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="signing-workitem">Signing</h3>
        <p>Mechanisms for signing TDs documents were under discussion in the last charter but were not mature enough to
        include. Adding support for TD canonicalization and signing would be helpful to ensure that TDs are not
        intercepted and modified by third parties. Verifying a signature requires identity management, i.e. the
        verifier needs to know or have trusted access to the public key of the signer. Directories need to be extended
        to verify signatures and generate new chained signatures as needed.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="timeseries-workitem">Timeseries</h3>
        <p>Some edge and cloud services can collect property value changes or event emissions for a certain time. This
        data, called timeseries, can be retrieved by Consumers to display the evolution of the affordance data over
        time, make predictions about the future values and more. There are different serialization formats and
        structures of such data in existing solutions. The generic mechanism for timeseries should be introduced in the
        <a href="#thing-description-deliverable">Thing Description</a> with bindings to existing solutions illustrated
        in the <a href="#binding-deliverable">Binding Templates</a></p>
        <p>Related Issues:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>https://github.com/w3c/wot-thing-description/issues/892</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="payload-protocols-workitem">Payload Driven Protocols</h3>
        <p>Some protocols are built on top of the application layer protocols. Some examples are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>RPC protocols on top of HTTP such as JSON-RPC.</li>
          <li>Protocols using MQTT topics together with payloads to identify affordances.</li>
          <li>Websocket sub-protocols.</li>
          <li>SSE usage across implementations.</li>
          <li>Webhook usage across implementations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>The <a href="#thing-description-deliverable">Thing Description</a> should be updated with mechanisms that
        make it possible to describe such protocols while optimizing the TD instances to be human and machine readable.
        The <a href="#binding-deliverable">Binding Templates</a> should be updated with concrete cases where this
        mechanism is already used. The <a href="#profiles-deliverable">Profiles</a> can use this mechanism to reduce
        the size of TDs while making them easier to understand. The working group will also document in which cases
        this method does not work due to making the TDs too complicated to understand, thus requiring a binding
        document.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 id="manageable-actions-workitem">Manageable Actions</h3>
        <p>Various use cases require the implementation of more complex actions that span multiple protocol
        transactions. Such actions are not simply invoked but need to managed over time by the Thing and the Consumer.
        These are covered in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wot-thing-description11/">WoT Thing Description 1.1</a>
        via the initiation (<code>invokeaction</code>), monitoring (<code>queryaction</code>), and cancellation
        (<code>cancelaction</code>) of ongoing actions. However, the following points are not supported:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sent and received payloads associated to the operations</li>
          <li>Management of dynamically generated identification</li>
          <li>Describing queues of actions</li>
        </ul>These limitations are also influencing the <a href="#profiles-deliverable">Profiles</a>.
        <p></p>
        <p>Additionally, there have been proposals by the WG members that need to taken into account and evaluated:</p>
        <ul>

      <section>
        <h3 id="init-connection-workitem">Initial / Common Connection Description</h3>
        <p>Currently, each form of an affordance has information on the endpoint, media type and other protocol related
        information. It is possible to use the <code>base</code> term for simplifying the endpoint but it has
        limitations such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If the media type is also common across forms, it is repeated</li>
          <li>Multiple bases are not possible</li>
          <li>For protocols that are based on an initial connection and then subsequent messages, the semantics are not
          clear.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Thus, a mechanism to describe connection and protocol information that can be used by other forms is needed.
        In protocols with initial connection, this can be also used to indicate what needs to be done by the Consumer
        before executing any operation.</p>

      <section>
        <h3 id="canon-workitem">Canonicalization</h3>
        <p>Thing Descriptions can contain the same information but serialized differently even in the same
        serialization format, due to structures such as maps which do not impose an order. This is problematic for
        comparing TDs or more importantly, for signing them where every byte difference results in a different
        signature. Thus, the WG will develop a canonicalization algorithm based on JSON-LD.</p>

        <h3 id="td-versioning-workitem">TD Versioning</h3>
        <p>TD allows themselves to be versioned. However, the semantics of such versioning is not defined, i.e. the
        meaning of version numbers. This makes it difficult to manage TDs and results in different behavior across
        versioned TD repositories. The WG will define the semantics of versions of a TD and recommendations on how to
        manage different versions of TDs.</p>

        <h3 id="td-consumption-workitem">TD Parsing, Consumption and Validation</h3>
        <p>Currently the TD specification defines an abstract information model and a default JSON serialization for
        TDs. However, parsing, consuming and validating TDs are not normatively defined. A validation process is
        defined but is not normative, which leads to certain ambiguities for a Consumer parsing a TD. Additionally, no
        method is proposed for validation the extensions that are used via the prefixes and the <code>@context</code>.
        The WG will specify normative algorithms for parsing, consuming and validating TDs to ensure interoperability
        of Consumers.</p>

        <p>Linting rules exist for programming languages or for API specifications in order to establish custom rules
        within projects. How these rules can be defined for TDs is not specified in any way, making it difficult to
        constrain flexibility of TDs in a standardized manner. The WG will define the mechanism for linting TDs
        together with optional rules that can be used by different projects.</p>

          <li>Ask the WoT CG for the WG members to be invited in W3C WoT CG meetups.</li>
          <li>Ask for use cases from the WoT CG and analyze them.</li>
          <li>Collect implementations from CG participants for Plugfest and Testfest efforts.</li>

          </li>
          <li>Normatively define one or more profiles which specify how to observe properties and subscribe to events
          over HTTP, e.g. using Server-Sent Events and/or Webhooks</li>
          <li>Consider defining other profiles, e.g. a CoAP-based profile for constrained devices which do not have the

          <li>Stretch goal: Specify an updated profiling mechanism which reuses the sub-protocol and context extension
          mechanisms from the WoT Thing Description specification, in order to more tightly constrain how profiles are
