# Relationship among WoT Groups

As asked in the previous main call, here is my opinion on how different WoT groups within W3C can/should be linked to each other. I was asked to write something short so here it is:

- WoT WG: Responsible for writing normative and informative W3C technical reports, as well as establishing liaisons with related SDOs.
- WoT IG: Responsible for doing official outreach, collecting use cases to extract requirements, and organizing plugfests.
- Related CGs: They can participate in the activities of the WG or IG through well-defined mechanisms in addition to their own activities. See below for more details.

Of course, there are relationships between those activities. E.g. use cases relate to TRs, outreach and plugfests related to CGs. Per activity, a more detailed relationship is written below. I will make small diagrams per activity as well

- Technical Report process: The IG should extract requirements from the use cases and makes them ready for the WG. Thus, the requirements are IG resources. The WG decides whether those requirements are correct and are not already addressed. If not, a feature description to satisfy the requirement should be extracted. This feature description drives the TR work for the relevant Task Forces of the WG. It is up to the TF to decide whether that feature is prioritized.
- Use Case process: The IG prepares a template for all groups to use when they want to document a WoT-related use case. This template can be used by any W3C group or liaison to explain the use case.   If a CG fills the use case template, it should be a document under that CG's ownership. The IG can use that use case to extract the requirements while contacting the stakeholders as necessary.
- Plugfest process: The IG decides that a Plugfest should take place. It contacts the related CGs and liaisons. Each group can organize the topics they want to focus on for that plugfest or IG can give specific topics of interest.
- Outreach process: IG maintains the official website and official social media accounts. It can incorporate content from other groups by linking (or a similar procedure) to them.
- Testing process: Will be edited

**Note:** Figure explaining the different processes will be inserted here.

Notes:
- WebAssembly WG says that contribution requires participation in the CG first.
- Test cases: Should we say that all input should go to one CG (WoT CG?) first?
