    <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

    <p class="mission">
      <!-- counter the fragmentation needs to be changed but not sure what to use -->
      The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working Group</a>
      is to counter the fragmentation of the IoT through the specification of building blocks
      that enable easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT platforms and application domains.
      These building blocks should complement and enhance the use of existing standards, and allow WoT to
      be used within other ecosystems and communities.
      This reduces the initial friction for adoption and supports further industry adoption.
      <span class="todo">This Working Group Charter covers those aspects that the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">Web of Things Interest Group</a>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/12/wot-ig-2021.html">(charter here)</a>
        believes are mature enough to progress to W3C Recommendations.

      <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
      <!-- Brief background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry. -->
      <p>As a continuation of the work in <a href="https://www.w3.org/2022/07/wot-wg-2022.html">the previous charter</a>, 
        this working group is tasked with the standardization or extension of the building blocks

        Things Interest Group</a> (IG) as being important to advance the Web of Things.
        The WoT building blocks are intended to complement and integrate to existing and emerging IoT standards using Web technologies. 
        As a result, the building blocks focus on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability in the IoT.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <!-- What exactly is in scope, and out of scope.
          For legal review. Be brief. -->
      <p>During this charter, the Working Group would work on the following:</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>
		<strong>Support New Use Cases</strong>:
          </dt>
          <dd>Address the requirements of new use cases, such as Digital Twins and integration with edge and cloud systems.
	    and interworking with edge and cloud systems.
	    The WG intends to define canonical TDs, add a mechanism to sign TDs, 
            define how to manage versions and how to validate TDs.
          </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong>Update Existing Specifications</strong>:
	  </dt>
          <dd>The WG will add new features and address issues discovered during implementation of the current set of specifications. 
            These are not be limited to backward-compatible updates, however great care will be taken to minimize 
	    the impact on existing implementations.
          </dd>
          <dt>
		<strong>Support WoT Interoperability</strong>:
	  </dt>
          <dd>The WG will improve out-of-the-box interoperability and enable the integration of WoT into other ecosystems and communities. 
            Thus, the WG will define core binding and profiling mechanisms, specify additional protocol and payload bindings, 
            and define appropriate profiles.
          </dd>
          <dt>
          	<strong>Improve Management of TDs</strong>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Additional mechanisms around for the management of TDs are needed to improve workflows that use them. 
            Thus, the WG will update the Discovery specification with additional features, including geolocation. 
          </dd>
          <dt>
            	<strong>Increase Descriptiveness of TDs</strong>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The WG will work on increasing the descriptive power of TDs to allow using them in wider use cases. This includes
            describing dynamic resources, historical values (timeseries), describing payloads, both static and dynamic
            geolocation information, manageable actions and more precise definitions of data schemas for each type of operation.
          </dd>
          <dt>
	   	<strong>Improve Security and Privacy</strong>:
	  </dt>
          <dd>
            Define reusable external(?) security vocabularies, simplify the use of security schemes, 
            and other work as appropriate.
          </dd>
        </dl>

      <p>
        Details for planned work items, which however are subject to change, are available in a

          <dd>The scope of the Working Group is restricted to APIs and security frameworks that are applicable across
            platforms.
            We will not define new security mechanisms but will use existing mechanisms and best practices.</dd>
          <dt><strong>Modification of protocols:</strong></dt>
          <dd>If during work on protocol bindings, it becomes apparent that changes are needed to protocols,
            the Web of Things Working Group will rely on the organization responsible for the protocol to make the
            changes.
            It is out of scope for the Working Group to standardize such changes itself.</dd>

      <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
        Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
          title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
        Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development
        of
        each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
        encouraged
        to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a
        review.
      </p>

      <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      <p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility
        review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible
          Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific

        Participation
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration,
        including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for
        each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a
        working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
        described in <a
          href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html#communication">Communication</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement
        to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
        W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

        Communication
      </h2>
      <p id="public">
        Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
        teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
        tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working
        Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct
        public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
        meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things (WoT) Working Group home
          page.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Web of Things (WoT) Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications,
        and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. However, one teleconference will be held weekly to coordinate
        activities among the task forces responsible for each specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group primarily conducts its technical work
        on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/wot">GitHub issues</a>, using
        a main repository for general topics and more specific repositories for individual specifications.
        The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
        Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a
        discussion.

    <section id="decisions">
      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
        Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
        members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
        consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
        with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication
        decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based
        survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the
        group consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
        consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available
        or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the
        Process Document requires.
