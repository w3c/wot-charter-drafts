    <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

    <p class="mission">
      <!-- counter the fragmentation needs to be changed but not sure what to use -->
      The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/wot">Web of Things Working Group</a>
      is to counter the fragmentation of the IoT through the specification of building blocks
      that enable easy integration of IoT devices and services across IoT platforms and application domains.
      These building blocks should complement and enhance the use of existing standards, and allow WoT to
      be used within other ecosystems and communities.
      This reduces the initial friction for adoption and supports further industry adoption.
      <span class="todo">This Working Group Charter covers those aspects that the
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/groups/ig/wot">Web of Things Interest Group</a>

        The WoT building blocks are intended to complement and integrate to existing and emerging IoT standards using Web technologies. 
        As a result, the building blocks focus on enabling cross-platform and cross-domain interoperability in the IoT.

      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <!-- What exactly is in scope, and out of scope.
          For legal review. Be brief. -->

      <p>During this charter, the Working Group would work on the following:</p>
      <p>
        Interoperability profiles for out-of-the-box interoperability with other ecosystems;
        protocol and payload bindings for the integration with other ecosystems, e.g. OPC UA and Cloud systems; 
        extending the descriptive power of Thing Descriptions, as well as various enhancements to the discovery mechanism,
        to enable further use cases and requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scope includes:
      </p>
        <dl>
          <dt>
		<strong>Support New Use Cases</strong>:
          </dt>
          <dd>Address the requirements of new use cases, such as Digital Twins and integration with edge and cloud systems.
         </dd>
	  <dt>
		<strong>Update and Refactor Existing Specifications</strong>:
	  </dt>
          <dd>The WG will add new features, address issues discovered during implementation of the current set of specifications,
          and reorganize material between documents as appropriate. 
            These are not be limited to backward-compatible updates, however great care will be taken to minimize 
	    the impact on existing implementations.
          </dd>
          <dt>
		<strong>Support WoT Interoperability</strong>:
	  </dt>
          <dd>The WG will improve out-of-the-box interoperability and enable the integration of WoT into other ecosystems and communities. 
            Thus, the WG will define core binding and profiling mechanisms, specify additional protocol and payload bindings, 
            and define appropriate profiles.
          </dd>
          <dt>
          	<strong>Improve Management of TDs</strong>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Additional mechanisms around for the management of TDs are needed to improve workflows that use them. 
            Thus, the WG will update the Discovery specification with additional features, including geolocation. 
          </dd>
          <dt>
            	<strong>Increase Descriptiveness of TDs</strong>:
          </dt>
          <dd>
            The WG will work on increasing the descriptive power of TDs to allow using them in additional use cases. This includes
            describing dynamic resources, historical values (timeseries), better describing payloads, both static and dynamic
            geolocation information, manageable actions and more precise definitions of data schemas for each type of operation.
          </dd>
          <dt>
	   	<strong>Improve Security and Privacy</strong>:
	  </dt>
          <dd>
            Define modular security vocabularies, simplify the use of security schemes, 
            and other work as appropriate.
          </dd>
        </dl>

            platforms.
            We will not define new security mechanisms but will use existing mechanisms and best practices.</dd>
          <dt><strong>Modification of protocols:</strong></dt>
          <dd>If during work on protocol bindings, it becomes apparent that changes are needed to protocols,
            the Web of Things Working Group will rely on the organization responsible for the protocol to make the

      <!-- Testing and interop -->
      <p>In order to advance to
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed
          Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent
          interoperable
          implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
        interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites, and two or
        more implementations interoperating with each other. In order to advance to
        Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
        test suite of every feature defined in the specification.
      </p>
      <p>A testing plan will be developed for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
      <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications
        in Candidate Recommendation
        or to features that have deployed implementations
        should have <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html">tests</a>.

        <!-- Horizontal review -->
      <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for
        implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
      <!--
	  <p><i class="todo">For specifications of technologies that directly impact user experience, such as content technologies, as well as protocols and APIs which impact content: </i>
		Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
		recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
-->

    <section id="coordination">
      <h2>Coordination</h2>
      <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
        accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
        Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
          title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
        Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>. The
        Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development
        of
        each specification. The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is
        encouraged
        to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a
        review.
      </p>

      <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      <p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility
        review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible
          Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific

        Participation
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration,
        including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for
        each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a
        working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as
        described in <a

      </p>
      <p>
        The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement
        to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
        W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

      <p id="public">
        Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from
        teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue
        tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working
        Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct
        public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and
        meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/">Web of Things (WoT) Working Group home
          page.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Web of Things (WoT) Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications,
        and will be conducted on an as-needed basis. However, one teleconference will be held weekly to coordinate
        activities among the task forces responsible for each specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group primarily conducts its technical work
        on <a id="public-github" href="https://github.com/w3c/wot">GitHub issues</a>, using
        a main repository for general topics and more specific repositories for individual specifications.
        The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the
        Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a
        discussion.

    <section id="decisions">
      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a
          href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>.
        Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with
        members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful
        consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along
        with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, resolutions 
        both proposed and taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

        A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all such resolutions (via email)
        with a response period from 5 to 10 working days, depending on the Chairs' evaluation of the
        group consensus on the issue.

        If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have
        consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, resolutions can be announced and proposed in advance, by circulating an email to the group
        with concrete proposed text for the resolution.  In these cases, the announcement can be considered the 
        call for consensus (CfC) and when the resolution is made by the group, it can be considered final, at the 
        discretion of the Chairs, if sufficient time (5 to 10 working days, at the discretion of the Chairs, as above)
        has been allowed for asynchronous input.  
        This process will be followed especially for publication decisions which are then effective immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available
        or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C
          Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the
